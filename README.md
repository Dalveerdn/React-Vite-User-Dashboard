   **Node JS**\
   **Express**\
   **Https**\

# Notes:
 In backend Create **.env.local** then add **dbKey**, **PORT** also setup SSL Certificate files with names **server.cert**, **server.key**. Backend is also serving index.html file so it's a node js application too. Check package.Json file for dependencies.
